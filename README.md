# Movie Swiper

Movie Swiper is a fun and interactive web application that helps users discover new movies through a swipe-based interface. Similar to a dating app, users can swipe right on movies they like and left on those they don’t, making it easy to find a film to watch. The app is built with a modern tech stack and features real-time session matching.
